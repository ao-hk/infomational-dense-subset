    "Finding densest $k$-subgraphs is a well-known NP-hard problem, but it is useful to identify clusters that are tightly connected subsets. Existing work cannot find the densest $k$-subgraphs that are non-maximal. We defined a new notion of strength for the subsets in the network with a higher-order dependency structure modeled by a supermodular function. By using the notion of strength, we proposed a framework for finding maximal strong communities, which enables us to identify more densest $k$-subgraphs in polynomial time than existing work. In particular, many existing works are confined to finding maximal densest $k$-subgraphs. There are also compact dense subgraphs that are not the densest $k$-subgraphs, and our framework for finding maximal strong communities can identify them. Unlike existing work that defines locally densest subgraphs with no natural extensions to weighted graphs, our framework covers weighted/unweighted directed/undirected graphs/hypergraph as special cases. It also applies to a general notion of the density of information well beyond weighted graphs."
